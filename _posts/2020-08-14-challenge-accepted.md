A (not so) long time ago 📅 in a galaxy 🌌 far, far away ✨ (not really), someone❔ (I won't mention any names 😄) challenged me to write something like a 90's blog post... and I couldn't really resist (O my precious ego, where art thou?)... and that's it... this is pretty much how I ended up creating that diary 🖊️/ blog 📔 / whatever, your pick 🤷‍♀️, trying to live up to my own words, like some sort grown-up gurl.

Also, being overly redundant 💬: check ✔️.

Uneventful, innit? Oh, Segue...
