A (not so) long time ago 📅 in a galaxy 🌌 far, far away ✨ (not really), someone❔ (I won't mention any names 😄) challenged me to write something... and I couldn't really resist (O my precious ego, where art thou?)... and that's pretty much how I ended up creating that diary 📔 / blog / whatever / your pick 🤷‍♀️.

Also, being overly redundant 💬: check ✔️.
