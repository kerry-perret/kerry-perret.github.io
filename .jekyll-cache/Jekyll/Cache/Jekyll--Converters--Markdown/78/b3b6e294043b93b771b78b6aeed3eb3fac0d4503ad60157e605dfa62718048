<p>It happens that when going through interview rounds, your interviewers are perhaps curiously and ironically not really ready… for testing your coding abilities 👩‍💻!</p>

<p>For example, they would like to proceed to some sort of online🌐 pair programming but they are doing it the wrong way, like asking you to code directly on Skype (be in in the message box or via a sharing screen feature). You may think I am cracking a joke😹, well it did actually happen quite a few times to me🤦‍♀️, so better be prepared! Not only coding in the Skype message box💬 is more error-prone for you as an interviewee… but it is also the case for your interviewer as well!🤕</p>

<p>It can also occur that you would like share some code ideas in an interactive fashion✍️.</p>

<p>Either way, it’s always nice to have something working out-of-the-box⌨️, saving you a lot of time⏱️ and hassle🤕.</p>

<h1 id="some-available-solutions">(Some) Available Solutions</h1>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://codeshare.io">Codeshare</a>: just an online notepad… no autocompletion or running capabilities.</li>
  <li><a href="https://coderpad.io">CoderPad</a>: non-free but provides running and (some) autocompletion capabilities.</li>
  <li><a href="https://codebunk.com">CodeBunk</a>: same as <a href="https://coderpad.io">CoderPad</a> but with slightly more options.</li>
  <li><a href="https://codeinterview.io">CodeInterview</a>: akin <a href="https://codebunk.com">CodeBunk</a> with better and sleak UI.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although they are not free (unless you wanna spend your time creating multiple accounts to keep benefiting from the free trial stuff), I usually go with either <a href="https://codebunk.com">CodeBunk</a> or <a href="https://codeinterview.io">CodeInterview</a>, since they both provide everything I need to assess🧪 the candidates I’m interviewing👩‍💻:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Both platforms record coding interview sessions, it’s good for multiple reasons:
    <ul>
      <li>I can step back and resume at a later point in times, it gives a more “nuanced vision👓” of what happened during the interview process.</li>
      <li>As an interviewer, you might also be rushed⚡ by other things at work, be it before the interview or even during the interview⏲️. As such your ad-hoc perception of what happened during the interview might be a tad biased.</li>
      <li>Review what did work✔️ and what didn’t❌ (including my own faux pas😳).</li>
      <li>Ask around for feedback, and see if whether I’ve been too harsh😡 or conversely overly nice🧸 with the candidate.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I don’t really need auto-completion🤏, the reason is, I let candidates google everything they need and the coding interview is bts rather a good excuse to discuss their thought process along with asking them a bunch of tech. questions on the relevant topics. I make sure that the candidates I’m interviewing are always at ease☮️ with me.</li>
  <li>The thing you really don’t want to happen during an interview is to have your candidate stressing out! Speaking of which, I don’t really get why the “bad cop 👮 + good cop👮‍♀️” style of interview is still so prevalent in IT (but hey I don’t get to decide about every single thing in our whole damn world🗺️, please, next time, 🗳️”Vote Kerry”👩).</li>
  <li>Anyhoo, there are still plenty of other things I don’t really get about “our industry”💻🏭 and this might be very much for another post📝.</li>
</ul>
